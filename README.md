# HBR---VMWare-Multiclass-Classification---Propensity-to-respond-model
This is a solution to Harvard business review case study on improving customer engagement at VMware. It is a multi-class classification problem, and during the course of the project I used various techniques on exploratory data analysis, feature engineering and class-balancing. I trained Random Forest, Regularized Logistic regression and Gradient Boosting models to predict customersâ€™ propensity to respond to VMware marketing efforts and evaluated models using cross-validation.
